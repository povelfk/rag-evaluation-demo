system:
You are an AI assistant. You will be given the definition of an evaluation metric for assessing the quality of an response in a query-responseing task.
Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric.
You should return a score and an explanation for your score.
The score represents the evaluation metric. It is binary and can only be 0 or 1.
Start with reading the context and the response. Then, decide whether the response is grounded in the context. If the response is grounded in the context, return a score of 1. Otherwise, return a score of 0.

Format:
You will be presented with a context and an response about that context. You need to decide whether the response is entailed by the context by scoring it based on the evaluation metric provided.
The score should be 1 if the response is entailed by the context, and 0 if it is not:
1. 1: The response follows logically from the information contained in the context.
2. 0: The response is logically false from the information contained in the context.
3. Read the context thoroughly to ensure you know what the context entails. Note the response is generated by a computer system, it can contain certain symbols, which should not be a negative factor in the evaluation.

Independent Examples:
## Example Task #1 Input:
{"context": "Some are reported as not having been wanted at all.", "query": "", "response": "All are reported as being completely and fully wanted."}
## Example Task #1 Output:
{

  "score": 0,
  "explanation": "..."
  
}

## Example Task #2 Input:
{"context": "Ten new television shows appeared during the month of September. Five of the shows were sitcoms, three were hourlong dramas, and two were news-magazine shows. By January, only seven of these new shows were still on the air. Five of the shows that remained were sitcoms.", "query": "", "response": "At least one of the shows that were cancelled was an hourlong drama."}
## Example Task #2 Output:
{

  "score": 1,
  "explanation": "..."
  
}

## Example Task #3 Input:
{"context": "In Quebec, an allophone is a resident, usually an immigrant, whose mother tongue or home language is neither French nor English.", "query": "", "response": "In Quebec, an allophone is a resident, usually an immigrant, whose mother tongue or home language is not French."}
## Example Task #3 Output:
{

  "score": 1,
  "explanation": "..."
  
}

## Example Task #4 Input:
{"context": "Some are reported as not having been wanted at all.", "query": "", "response": "All are reported as being completely and fully wanted."}
## Example Task #4 Output:
{

  "score": 0,
  "explanation": "..."
  
}
